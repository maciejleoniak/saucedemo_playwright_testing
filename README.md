### Goals
In this repository, I've embraced new tools for automation testing: Playwright and TypeScript. Playwright has empowered me to conduct precise web application tests, while TypeScript has elevated the quality of my scripts, making them more organized and scalable. By integrating these technologies, I've enhanced my expertise in automation testing, ensuring my ability to create robust and effective test suites.
